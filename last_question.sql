/*
Code Implementation Task: If this list would be a database table, 
please provide SQL query to fill in the missing daily vaccination 
numbers with discrete median of country as similar to question a.  
Please  provide the link to your code as answer to this question. 
Note: This time SQL equivalent is requested, and imputation value is 
median of each country, not minimum. Please remember filling countries
with zero if they do not have any valid daily_vaccination records 
like Kuwait.
